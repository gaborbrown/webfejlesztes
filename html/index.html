                                A tennis court is a sporting area that adheres to precise dimensions and specifications for optimal play. It is a rectangle measuring 23.77 meters in length and 8.23 meters in width for singles matches, which expands to 10.97 meters for doubles. The net, bisecting the court, has a height of 0.91 meters at the center and 1.07 meters at the posts. The surface can vary - grass, clay, or hardcourt - each impacting the game's speed and playing style. The court must also account for drainage, to prevent water accumulation. Adherence to technical details ensures that the court meets the standards set by governing bodies like the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and provides a fair and consistent playing field.

                                A match is divided into sets and games, with a player winning a set by winning at least six games with a two-game margin. The scoring within games is unique, progressing from love (zero), to 15, 30, and 40, with the next point after 40 winning the game, unless both players reach 40 (deuce). From deuce, a player must win two consecutive points to win the game: the first point leads to 'advantage', and winning the next secures the game. If the opponent wins the point during advantage, the score returns to deuce. The serve, a critical part of the game, must be delivered diagonally across the net into the opponent's service box. If the serve fails to land in the correct box or hits the net, it is a fault; two consecutive faults result in losing the point. Play alternates between baseline rallies and net play, with points won by hitting the ball so the opponent cannot return it within the court boundaries, or if the opponent commits an error like a double fault or a ball hit outside the court's boundaries. The rules also govern player conduct, equipment specifications, and line calls, ensuring fair play and sportsmanship.

                        <p>
                            Tennis features a diverse array of shots, each with its own strategic purpose and technique. The serve, initiating play, varies from powerful flat serves to spin-heavy slice or kick serves. The forehand and backhand, fundamental strokes, can be executed with either one or two hands on the racket. The volley, a shot taken before the ball bounces, is essential in net play. The lob, a tactical shot, arcs the ball high over the opponent to land deep in the court, often used to counter net rushers. The drop shot, in contrast, delicately taps the ball just over the net, making it fall rapidly on the opponent's side. The overhead smash is a powerful, descending shot, typically used to counter lobs. Spin plays a crucial role, with topspin adding forward rotation to the ball, causing it to dip and bounce high, while backspin (or slice) causes the ball to skid and stay low. Players also utilize various angles and depths, crafting cross-court or down-the-line shots to maneuver opponents and create openings. Mastery of these shots, combined with strategic application, forms the crux of a player's game plan in tennis.
